# Vector Search
A sub repository for learning the basics about Embeddings (Vectors) and Vector Search

## What is Vector Search?
Vector Search is a means to search over unstructured data, whether that be text or images by leveraging Machine Learning. Developers will capture context of this unstructured data and represent them numerically as vectors. Given vectors, we can then determine which vectors are numerically similar and thus contextually similar. 

## Why is Vector Search important
Vector Search is important for the same reason full text search is important. It allows us to enahnce an end-user's experience by bringing the data they are searching for closer to them. Reflect on how many times you've needed to search for something you didn't quite know the word of, but you knew it was a mammal with wings, nocturnal and made a "hoot" sound. Without typing in the keywords "bird" or "owl" you may still have hard time finding relevant search results. Vector search overcomes this limitation, allowing you to search by what you mean. It can quickly deliver answers to queries based on context.
