# Search
A one-stop shop for learning everything about Search technologies and how they pertain to MongoDB

The purpose behind this repository is to teach everything a Solutions Architect would need to know about Text Search in order to educate their customers on the capabilities of what MongoDB Atlas Search can provide. Here you can learn about MongoDB native text search and why it is becoming obsolete, full text search and why it is becoming the industry standard for quickly retrieving data in a flexible manner, Lucene: the engine behind full text search, different full text search datastores that MongoDB will frequently compete against, and MongoDB Atlas: MongoDB's solution to a fully managed full text search solution.
